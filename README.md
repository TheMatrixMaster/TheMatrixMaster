## Hey there! I'm Stephen

I am a final year undergraduate student in computer science and biology at **[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/)**.

I enjoy spending my time coding, songwriting, hiking, and sharing my thoughts through my **[blog](https://matrixmaster.me/blog)**.

I was previously a co-founder and lead engineer at **[Hero AI](https://www.heroai.ca/)**, where I designed and developed the core frontend architecture for the flagship real-time dashboard and patient beacon products, did research on clinical screening models at the **[Hospital for Sick Children](https://www.sickkids.ca/)**, and completed internships at **Lino AI**, **[The Bagot Lab](https://www.bagotlab.org/)**, and **[The Ferbeyre Lab](http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/ferbeyre/index-en.htm)**.

I am also very grateful to be a **[Schulich Scholar](https://schulichleaders.com/)** and an alumnus of the **[Canada-Wide Science Fair](https://youthscience.ca/science-fairs/)** where I started my STEM journey.
