## Hey there! I'm Stephen

I am a PhD student at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Yun Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). I work on algorithms to learn the evolutionary and physical dynamics of proteins. Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to chat about my work or explore collaborations! You can also find me on [X](https://x.com/stephenzlu).
