## Hey there! I'm Stephen

I am a PhD student at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Yun Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/). I am broadly interested in developing data-driven methods to model physical systems — with a focus on biomolecular (proteins & small molecules) structure, function, and dynamics. Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to chat about my work or explore collaborations! You can also find me on [X](https://x.com/stephenzlu).
